# math301spring2025
Repository for Math 301 at Vassar College in the Spring 2025 semester.

## Local installation

First you need to install Visual Studio Code and the Lean 4 extension. Instructions for doing that are [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#regular-install).

Then it's just a matter of installing this repository onto your computer. There are two ways to do this.

### Local installation via point-and-click

The most painless way to install the repository is using VS Code directly. With Lean installed, open any file on your system in VS Code, and then click on the upside-down A

![an upside-down A](figures/lean_symbol.png?raw=true "An upside-down A")

and select `Open Project` -> `Project: Download Project`. Type in the following URL into the text box which appeared:

```
https://github.com/tghyde/math301spring2025.git
```

and then select the directory where you want the project installed, type in the name of a folder (for math301spring2025) and then wait for a minute or two while everything downloads and compiles. Then accept the suggestion to open the course directory, and you should be up and running. Open up VS Code's file explorer (top left of screen)

 and navigate to the `Math301spring2025` directory, where you should find a folder called `Section 1 Logic` which is where you should get started.
